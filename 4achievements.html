            <h3> These are my achievements during the College Of Technology days, I recieved a Dean's listers award by the average of 1.7 and with that, I also recieved a trophy as 1st placer by joining the COT GOT TALENT. I didn't expect to recieve this kind of awards, I don't recieved this much awards during my Elementary and Highschool days, so I humbly proud of myself by receiving it and hopefully there will be more in the future. </h3>
